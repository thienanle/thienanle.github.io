  <p>The Khalibre Platform is a SaaS that was originally created to help large missions organizations manage and provide training for their workers. Its communities feature offers tools for collaboration, bringing people together around topics such as a team working on a project or a missions worker sharing his/her updates to supporters.</p>

<p><a href="1.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="1.webp" alt="Courses offered in the Khalibre Learning Hub community." /></a></p>

<p>After I join a community, I can access member features such as posts and file sharing. On the Learning page, I can browse for courses that the community offers.</p>

<p>The <strong>My Learning</strong> page, which is global and sits outside of communities, allows me to see all the courses I’ve booked in one place, regardless of which community they are from.</p>

<p>When browsing a community’s courses, if I click on a course I’ve already booked, rather than being given the option to book the course, I get the option to “enter” the course, which takes me to the learning view.</p>

<div class="columns">

  </a>
</div>

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>

<p>In a support ticket, a customer requested the following, paraphrased by me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a community, to find and enter a course after having previously booked it requires several extra steps.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Users need to change the sort order from “most popular” to “alphabetical” each time and then find the course by name.</li>
    <li>After clicking on the booked course, user clicks on an activity but nothing happens. User needs to click on “enter course” and then can click on an activity.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please change the default sort to “alphabetical” and skip the step of needing to click “enter course” again if the user has already booked the course.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="research">Research</h1>

<p><strong>Question 1: why were users not using the My Learning page to find their booked courses?</strong></p>

<p>This is what the My Learning page was designed for. Through conversations with the customer it quickly became evident that many users think of the platform in the context of communities. “I found and booked this course here, and I want to continue it here.” Even a seasoned user of the platform might find it more natural to access a course offered by a community by going to that community first.</p>

<p><a href="1.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="1.webp" alt="The community Learning page already has a link to go to My Learning, but users are not using it." /></a></p>

<p><strong>Question 2: why the default sort was “most popular” in the first place, and is alphabetical sorting the answer?</strong></p>

<p>I researched many websites and apps to understand why different sort options are used.</p>

<p>What I found:</p>

<!-- {:.pull-quote}
> “People rarely think A-Z”\
— [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/alphabetical-sorting-must-mostly-die/) -->

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Alphabetical sorting is useful in cases where the names of items in a list are known. An example would be a list of people I’m connected with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On many sites, the user does not know the names of items in a list. The user is there to search or browse based on some criteria. The word the user is looking for might not be at the beginning of the title, so alphabetical sorting would not help, but would arbitrarily give prominence to titles that start with A or B or C. Therefore, the order should consider other outcomes, such as surfacing content that is most relevant to users.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote class="big-quote">
  <p>“People rarely think A-Z”
— <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/alphabetical-sorting-must-mostly-die/">Nielsen Norman Group</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our case, the community Learning page is a catalog of courses available for booking, where users don’t typically know the specific title of what they’re looking for because they’re browsing to discover content. If they did know the title, they would likely use search to find it.</p>

<p>The ideal sort would rely on an algorithm to surface content that is most relevant to users. The “most popular” sort became the default way to infer relevance in lieu of a more complex algorithm.</p>

<h1 id="the-root-problem">The Root Problem</h1>

<p>The purpose of the Learning page in communities is to show the courses that are offered by the community. Understandably, learners are coming back here to find the courses they booked, and the page was not designed to facilitate this. Changing the sort order to alphabetical might make it easier to find my course, but only if I remember the name and the list of courses isn’t too long.</p>

<h1 id="the-design">The Design</h1>

<p>To solve the problem I found it necessary to 1) make it easier for users to easily <em>find</em> and <em>identify</em> courses that they already booked and 2) do this within the context of a community.</p>

<p>I wanted to create separation between booked and unbooked courses within the community, so that users don’t need to dig through one bucket to find the courses they’ve already booked. Here are two different design options:</p>

<p><a href="4.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="4.webp" alt="Option 1: Separate My Learning onto a different tab." /></a></p>

<p><a href="5.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="5.webp" alt="Option 2: Move my booked courses to the top of the existing list. Add a filter for booked/not booked." /></a></p>

<p>Option 1 creates clear separation, but requires extra work if the user wants to browse for courses. Option 2 retains the same UI that users are already familiar with while still creating separation between booked and unbooked courses. However, after discussing with the technical team, it would create a lot of technical complexity.</p>

<h1 id="the-result">The Result</h1>

<p><a href="6.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="6.webp" alt="The final result sorts by relevance, giving priority to booked courses." /></a></p>

<p>The above shows what was finally implemented. It is like option 2, but rather than creating 2 separate lists, we introduced a new default sort option<em>.</em> “Most relevant” presents courses in an order that is more valuable to learners by considering booked courses as an additional criteria for relevance.</p>

<p>Notice also that the booked courses have a clear indication that they are booked. Clicking on these courses links to the learner’s course view rather than the booking page, so there is no need for an additional “enter course” step.</p>

<h1 id="learnings">Learnings</h1>

<p>Design is not an island. No matter how good a design is, collaboration must happen with development to ensure the project is feasible and realistic. Listening to others’ feedback is important.</p>

<p>Pick your battles! A potential issue can arise where if a user has booked many courses, unbooked courses lose the their discoverability. The final implementation doesn’t include a filter for booked and unbooked courses, which would help with the issue. Leaving this out would not have been my first choice, but it meant the team could deliver on time a solution that addresses the customer’s most immediate needs.</p>

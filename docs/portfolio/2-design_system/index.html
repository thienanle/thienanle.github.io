  <p>The Khalibre Platform is a SaaS that was originally created to help large missions organizations manage and provide training for their workers. Its communities feature offers tools for collaboration, bringing people together around topics such as a team working on a project or a missions worker sharing his/her updates to supporters.</p>
  <p>I joined the team when the basics of these features had already been built, and have since helped to improve existing areas, design new features, and establish a consistent and robust design language for the product.</p>
</aside>

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>

<p>As with many digital products, the Khalibre Platform has seen its fair share of designers, developers, and product directors. When I joined the team, there were inconsistencies everywhere, from UI and UX to information architecture to code. I noticed redundancies in form elements and many definitions of nearly identical colors. These might not sound catastrophic, but in reality the issues across the system ran much deeper, and when added up they created a clumsy, confusing experience that did not instill confidence in users.</p>

<p><a href="1.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="1.webp" alt="A page with various UI inconsistencies. This is a test course and uses fake data." /></a></p>

<p>The screenshot above contains some examples of issues with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Casing: some buttons and headings used all caps, while others used sentence or title case.</li>
  <li>Information hierarchy: the title of the course is much smaller than the headings below it.</li>
  <li>Icons: lack of harmony due to different stroke widths and sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>

<p>At the core of the issues was a lack of clearly defined standards that could be a single source of truth across teams. My goals in creating a design system were to</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase consistency</strong> of the user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve maintainability and scalability</strong> of components.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed up</strong> <strong>design</strong> and <strong>development</strong> by providing a library of flexible, predefined components and resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Streamline handoff</strong> and <strong>foster collaboration</strong> between teams.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-process">The Process</h1>

<p>I was not given dedicated time to work on the design system, but built it up over time alongside my day-to-day project work. Therefore, multiple and varying cycles of the process outlined below happened over time.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Audit</strong> existing UI/UX elements and patterns in order to get a holistic view of redundancies and inconsistencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Research</strong> other design systems in the industry to learn about what works.</li>
  <li><strong>Consolidate</strong> and remove redundancies in existing components, variables, colors, and typography.</li>
  <li><strong>Create</strong> new components, variables, colors, and typography to fill in gaps and make the design library more comprehensive.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborate</strong> with developers to achieve parity between design and code.</li>
  <li><strong>Document</strong> standards and principles as guidelines for the team.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="the-design-system">The Design System</h1>

<p>Below are samples of the result of many iterations of the process I described in the previous section. The Khalibre Design System naturally continues to evolve with the product, but I would say it is at a place now where a majority of designs can be created using only existing components and patterns.</p>

<h2 id="stylistic-choices">Stylistic Choices</h2>

<p>When creating the design system, the Khalibre Platform was already a complex product with many screens and a large codebase. There were plans to rebuild some key areas, but the whole system would not be updated all at once.</p>

<p>The design system therefore adapted already-defined styles so that new pages could co-exist in harmony with what was already there. I also took the opportunity to refine and beautify many existing components.</p>

<h2 id="the-component-library">The Component Library</h2>

<p><a href="2.webp" class="photo-swipe no-caption"><img src="2.webp" alt="The component library" /></a></p>

<p>Key principles that went into creating the components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Components should only use sizes, colors, and typography predefined by the library for consistency and scalable future changes.</li>
  <li>Provide enough variants and properties so that instance overrides and detaching are unnecessary 99% of the time.</li>
  <li>Name properties so that components with equivalent properties retain their values if swapped.</li>
  <li>Define fundamental interactions such as hover states so that they work out of the box.</li>
  <li>Use instance swap properties only for nested instances that are designed to be swapped.</li>
  <li>Expose properties from nested instances to minimize time drilling down.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<p><a href="3.webp" class="photo-swipe no-caption"><img src="3.webp" alt="Variables" /></a></p>

<p>Some design thinking that went into this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Although a dark mode has yet to be implemented, variable names were chosen that would still make sense when a dark mode was added later.</li>
  <li>Tokenization was used as an abstraction layer and to provide context for where variables should be used.</li>
  <li>Typography considered consistent type scaling and specific line heights and paragraph spacing to achieve visual balance.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="4.webp" class="photo-swipe no-caption"><img src="4.webp" alt="Typography" /></a></p>

<h2 id="parity-with-code">Parity With Code</h2>

<p>The timing for me to begin working on the design system was good, partly because on the development side, the team was reaching a point where it was ready to move to a new framework for building the front end. I worked closely with (and sat next to) the lead developer on the project to produce components in Vue 3 that mirrored the definitions in Figma.</p>

<p>We also chose variable names that made sense both in Figma and in CSS. Using slashes in Figma makes it easy to organize and group variables, and also translates natively to the CSS dash naming convention.</p>

<p><a href="5.webp" class="photo-swipe no-caption"><img src="5.webp" alt="Variable names translate natively into the CSS dash naming convention." /></a></p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>I created and continuously updated documentation that supplemented the definitions in Figma. This includes <strong>UI development</strong> documents that focus on the technical aspects related to the design system, <strong>copywriting</strong> documents that set standards for things like tone, casing, internationalization, and the use of AI, and a <strong>design team handbook</strong> that brings together all of the various design resources and helps to onboard future designers.</p>

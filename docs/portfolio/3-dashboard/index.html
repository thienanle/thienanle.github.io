  <p>The Khalibre Platform is a SaaS that was originally created to help large missions organizations manage and provide training for their workers. Its communities feature offers tools for collaboration, bringing people together around topics such as a team working on a project or a missions worker sharing his/her updates to supporters.</p>
  <p>I joined the team when the basics of these features had already been built, and have since helped to improve existing areas, design new features, and establish a consistent and robust design language for the product.</p>
</aside>

<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>

<p>The Dashboard is the “Home” of the Khalibre Platform—the default place users go to after signing in.</p>

<p>When I was given this project, the Dashboard had existed for some time and was in need of a refresh. As the page that sees the most traffic on the platform, Khalibre wanted to improve the Dashboard to add more value to users. We wanted the Dashboard to be a central hub for users to quickly and easily:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Manage what is going on in courses and communities.</li>
  <li>Pick up where they left off. Many users complained that it was difficult for them to resume their course.</li>
  <li>See the latest things that are happening on the platform.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="opportunities-for-improvement">Opportunities for Improvement</h1>

<p><a href="1.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="1.webp" alt="The existing dashboard felt stale and didn’t help users get back to where they left off." /></a></p>

<p>The existing dashboard had a number of opportunities for improvement:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The equal weight of the 50/50 column layout did not help users to intuitively perceive importance and guide their attention.</li>
  <li>The UI didn’t have graceful fallbacks, so users were forced to either fill out information or be presented with undesirable placeholder text.</li>
  <li>Users were presented with UI and information that wasn’t useful. This could be taken out to make space for more useful things.</li>
  <li>While the <em>Discussion Updates</em> were useful but didn’t reveal much of the original topic, so replies felt like they lacked context.</li>
  <li>The <em>Your Learning</em> section was useful, but it didn’t prioritize courses based on urgency or last access, and didn’t provide “at a glance” information on progress and upcoming activities.</li>
  <li>There was an opportunity to surface comment activity to make posts more engaging.</li>
  <li>Not numbered in the screenshot above: there were general sizing, spacing, and typography inconsistencies that could be tidied up to create a more professional appearance.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="redesign">Redesign</h1>

<p><a href="2.webp" class="photo-swipe"><img src="2.webp" alt="The redesigned Dashboard surfaces more relevant content and links." /></a></p>

<p>Below is a list of some of the various improvements and rationale behind the redesign.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
  <li>3 column layout gives some hierarchy to the content: the central column is the primary content and left and right columns are utility. The left column is larger than the right, asserting its greater importance.</li>
  <li>Widget headings and spacing are consistent while allowing some variation for visual interest without creating imbalance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="left-column-management-updates-and-progress">Left Column: Management Updates and Progress</h3>

<p><a href="3.webp" class="photo-swipe no-caption"><img src="3.webp" alt="The left column shows users important updates and progress." /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>For users who are managers of learning and communities, staying on top of their responsibilities is a top priority. There are shortcuts to help them start virtual meetings on time, quickly see if there is any new discussion activity, and jump in to courses and communities that need the most urgent attention.</li>
  <li><em>My Learning Progress</em> helps users stay on top of their learning. Courses appear in priority order based on activities and meetings that are coming up soonest and recently visited courses.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="central-column-the-feed">Central Column: The Feed</h3>

<p><a href="4.webp" class="photo-swipe no-caption"><img src="4.webp" alt="The feed now shows discussion updates in addition to posts." /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Posts and discussions are grouped into one feed so that both posts and discussions form a continuous stream of updates. This
    <ul>
      <li>Encourages engagement by surfacing the latest comments/replies.</li>
      <li>Gives context to replies by showing the original post.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A filter allows users to see posts, discussions, or both.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="right-column-helpful-links">Right Column: Helpful Links</h3>

<p><a href="5.webp" class="photo-swipe no-caption"><img src="5.webp" alt="The right column shows helpful links to users." /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>A link encourages users to complete their profile. This only appears while it’s useful and then disappears once no longer relevant.</li>
  <li>Users often need to go back to something they recently accessed. The Recent widget links users to recent files, communities, courses, and user profiles.</li>
</ul>
